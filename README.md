## ðŸŒŸ **Key Features**

- **AI-based Locator Healing**: Automatically heals broken locators using TensorFlow models.
- **Backup Locators**: Provides fallback locators to ensure test continuity.
- **Reusable Utilities**: Includes helper functions for locator management.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.13.1 or later.
- Python 3.7+ (for TensorFlow dependencies on Windows).
- Windows Build Tools or equivalent for native modules.
